            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>Back when I was a high school student, I had average experiences like any other student. The best days were when I was with my friends doing fun stuff together (like hiding in school lockers to scare our teacher!) and then there were the bad days- pressure due to exams and tests, peer pressure, school and homework- particularly got worse as close the dreaded 12th grade came closer, as it was the deciding year that determined one's admission to their dream university. The pressure ramped up like crazy! During this period of my life I saw many of my friends break down due to pressure and stress. Often times I wondered why they wouldn't talk to the school psychiatrist who was there to help us with our mental health, and i wide range of comments such as: not enough time to discuss all the problems, unable to articulate them, stigma attached to mental health, ect.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Even my own problems had a similar problem, and when I was in school learning UX &amp; UI, for my final project I wanted to make something that could help tackle some of the problems so that the next generation of students don't face such difficult problems in school.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>CONVO is an app that sprung in my mind when I was talking to my teacher for the final project before the program was done. My target audience from the start were high school students with mental health issues. The desired outcome of the app was to help the students deal better with their health issues by creating an app that acted as their personal diary, as well as help them to communicate with their school psychiatrist.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>This project was a solo ride, so I was the principle researcher responsible for the research, user flow, wireframes, user interface and experience design. Since I was the only one working on this project, I faced a lot of problems that I had to deal with myself! One of the biggest problems were that I am a beginner and I had to learn a lot of the basic buildings blocks. Apps such as Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Invision were alien to me so I spent hours trying to figure how to make an app in the first place! Once I had practiced enough that I was dreaming about making apps in my sleep (this is a true story, by the way) I started seriously designing CONVO. However, I learning and making is a different story. I ended up making 40+ screens before realizing that I wasn't following the proper colour theory, IOS human interface guidelines and worst of all, my app didn't make any sense! I learned the hard way that because I was the designer, the app made sense to me, and might not necessarily make it to other people. So I had to ask for my brother's help, since he is a CTO of a startup company and had interviewed many prospective UX designers that wanted to work in his company, so he had an idea as to where I was going wrong. Not only that, he became a user tester for me as well, and helped me see where I was going wrong. I received many productive comments from him and so I had to begin again, this time I again started from the scratch, with messy handwritten low fidelity wireframes and user flows. However, this time I also studied similar apps and their interface, as well as non similar apps that had the same targeted demographics as me. The result was a newly designed CONVO app that have the same features but a massively different outlook. I also learned to make a more practical user interface design and not just depend on fancy colours, shapes and buttons that made an app look pretty but made it highly impractical.</strong></p></div>
